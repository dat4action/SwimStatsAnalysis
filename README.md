# SwimStatsAnalysis

## Description
The SwimStatsAnalysis repository is dedicated to in-depth statistical analysis of swimming competitions, utilizing real-world competition data to explore and answer important questions about athlete performance, trends, and influencing factors. The repository is designed to provide valuable insights for coaches, athletes, and swimming enthusiasts interested in understanding the dynamics of competitive swimming.

## Key Features

### Data Collection and Cleaning
The repository includes scripts and notebooks for collecting and cleaning swimming competition data from various sources. This data encompasses information about race times, event categories, athlete details, and more.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Through a series of Jupyter Notebooks, the repository guides users through the process of exploratory data analysis. Visualizations and summary statistics are used to uncover patterns and trends in swimmer performance across different events and competition types.

### Hypothesis Testing
The repository provides notebooks dedicated to hypothesis testing to address specific questions relevant to competitive swimming. It covers topics such as whether athletes swim faster in finals compared to preliminaries, whether there's a trend of slowing down in longer events, and whether lane assignment impacts race results.

### Documentation
The repository includes detailed documentation on data sources, methods, and explanations of statistical tests. This documentation is aimed at making the analysis approachable for both beginner and experienced data analysts.

## Example Hypothesis Tests

### Finals vs. Preliminaries Performance
The repository performs hypothesis tests to determine whether athletes swim faster in finals compared to preliminaries, analyzing various factors that might contribute to the difference in performance.

### Long Events and Slowdown
A hypothesis test investigates whether there is a statistically significant trend of athletes slowing down in longer swimming events. This could provide insights into pacing strategies and endurance.

### Impact of Lane Assignment
The repository explores whether the lane assignment has any influence on the race result. It investigates whether athletes in certain lanes have a statistical advantage, potentially due to water turbulence or other factors.

## Conclusion
SwimStatsAnalysis is a comprehensive repository that combines data analysis techniques with domain-specific knowledge to provide valuable insights into competitive swimming performance. By exploring real-world competition data and conducting hypothesis tests, the repository helps swimming enthusiasts make data-driven decisions and better understand the nuances of swimmer performance.
